This directory includes the code for the Perspectives Firefox client.  

For more information on Perspectives, see: http://www.perspectives-project.org

To build, just type "make" (assuming of course you have make installed!)

This will create a file called 'Perspectives.xpi'.  

You can run this in Firefox using File -> Open and browsing to the 
Perspectives.xpi file.
