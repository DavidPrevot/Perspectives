<!-- This file contains the 'description' and 'creator' strings that should be used inside install.rdf. 
Unfortunately there is no way to pull these strings into the file via code (although we could perhaps write a build script).
However, we don't want to forget to translate these when adding a new localization. Having these files is intended to help us remember.
So: translators, if you could translate these strings normally that would be great.
Developers: remember to copy/paste these strings into install.rdf when creating a new localization. -->
